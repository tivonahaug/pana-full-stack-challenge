## Coupa Travel Full-Stack Code Challenge

### The Challenge

The goal of this code challenge is to contribute to a sample front-end for one of our products, **Coupa Travel Flight Search**, using React.
You have received this at least a day before your technical interview. We expect you to spend around 30min - 1 hour familiarizing yourself with the code, and installing and running the app. Any time spent setting up the project during the interview will take away from time we have to actually solve the challenge.

Once you have the app up and running, you'll be presented with the challenge prompt. If you **want**, you may start implementing the changes requested in the challenge prompt. However, if you prefer to live code your solutions during the interview, that is completely fine. **Choosing not to start on the challenge will absolutely not count against your performance in the interview.** All we ask is that you familiarize yourself with the code prior to the interview.

**Another Framework**

- If you would like to complete the challenge in another framework (Angular, Vue, etc.), you're welcome to do so, however you will be responsible for duplicating the code challenge in that framework prior to arriving at the interview. You do not need to replicate the React app down to the pixel - a rough implementation is fine.
- Don't worry if you're not confident in React - We will gladly help you through framework related questions and your knowledge of a framework will not necessarily count against you and a lot of the following challenges are more focused on your knowledge of Javascript rather than a specific framework.

### Installation

- **API**

  - Located in `/server`
  - `$ npm install`
  - `$ nodemon` (for hot loading rebuilds) or `$ npm start`

- **UI**

  - Located in `/react-challenge`
  - `$ yarn install` or `$ npm install`
  - `$ yarn start` or `$ npm start`

Getting an error with the node sass module? See https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/2536

#### Core Requirements

- Work through this project according to the instructions page (this page will be the first thing that loads when the project builds)
- Use React or another frontend JS framework
  - Part of our goal is to see how you work through problems including fetching from an api, interpreting unfamiliar data, and reasoning about sorting and filter, not necessarily how well you know certain frameworks.

### Evaluation

- **JavaScript**
  - Cleanliness and organization of your code
  - Your ability to effectively leverage a framework
  - Appropriate use of known development patterns
- **Fundamentals**
  - Ability to debug someone elses code and make changes
  - Ability to implement sorting and filtering
  - Clear knowledge of Javascript fundamentals and patterns
  - How you take unfamiliar data and understand it
  - How you handle unexpected errors and loading times
