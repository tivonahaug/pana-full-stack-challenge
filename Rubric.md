# Engineering Rubric 

This rubric was initially built based off [Medium's engineering rubric](https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-grading-rubric-8b409bec021f).  The principle goal of this is to assess whether or not their coding skills are a match for Pana.  It is not about whether or not they are a good culture fit.  

Each question on this assessment can be ranked at a 1-5, similar to the other hiring assessments, where 1 represents an area of weakness and 5 represents an area of strength. (If that changes this should be updated to match)  where this person This assessment has two basic goals: 

Firstly, the goal is to answer whether or not we believe they can do they job we're asking of them. This maps to whether or not we think they can come in and make an impact on the dev team.  A person who averages a 1 on this exam we don't believe could come in and make much of an impact, whereas a 5 means we believe they would be a strong team member, regardless of their seniority.

Secondly, to get an understanding of what level we feel they most closely match at Pana.  Just because someone is applying at a particular role doesn't necessarily mean that's how we would assess them. A person who averages a 1 on this assessment would roughly correspond to a Junior level engineer, whereas a 5 would represent a senior engineer or a technical lead. 


## Can This Engineer Make a Contribution to the Team?

1. Act Like an Owner

Do they take ownership and show interest in the problem they’re trying to solve, or do they look like they’re trying to get through it to the end? A person rating at a 1 is going to care more about checking off all of the boxes, whereas a person rating a 5 will try to holistically understand the problem 

2. Ability to Build Software 

Is this person able to express themselves with code?   Do they have an ability to express themselves using code? Can they think through a problem clearly in order to solve the problem.  A person rating a 1 might struggle to start writing code and need to be led through the problem, whereas a 5 will quickly jot down thoughts and write pseudo-code or real code as they start thinking.  This is also an opportunity to talk about things like coding standards.

  
3. Web Fluency

Rate this person's understanding of web principles like HTTP, server v. browser logic, databases, etc. A person rating a 1 here might struggle to talk through concepts like HTML/CSS, or explain what the difference between 2XX and 5XX HTTP codes are.  A person rating a 5 will be able to talk about the benefits/costs of different web frameworks, when to server side render something, as well as new and upcoming web frameworks/techniques.

4. Curiosity

Rate this person's curiosity about the coding challenge.  Do they try to get a deeper understanding of the why behind the problem or are they trying to solve it as quickly as possible?  Do they ask a lot of questions and engage the interviewer during the process?  A 1 here will focus on the strict implementation of what is presented, whereas a 5 will try to get a deeper understanding of what's going on and may talk about tradeoffs. 

5. Communication/Collaboration

How does this person communicate during the process?  Do they talk you through their thought process and ask lots of questions or are they mostly silent?  If you push back on a particular implementation strategy do they get defensive/blindly agree, or do they engage with you?  A 1 here will 


## What Level Do We Assess This Engineer At 

It's important to remember that the goal of these questions is to place the interviewee at a particular level and not to eliminate them at the process. Someone who rates a 1 here might need more growing, but generally we see these types of things as growth areas and not requirements to get in the door.  It's possible that we rate someone a 1, and decide we don't have the bandwidth to support them, but might follow up later.


1. Framework Fluency

Do they have competency in things like Javascript/Knex/Postgres/React? If no, how quickly do they ask critical questions to learn and execute on the pieces they need?  If yes, how much do they build with the language and how much do they copy/repeat standards?  A 1 here might rely heavily on examples whereas a 5 will have a breadth of knowledge if different languages and can pull positives and negatives from each.

2. Perspective

How much experience do they have with different coding challenges or businesses? When they implement a particular solution are they copying the way they’ve seen it before, or synthesizing a variety of learnings from past approaches.  A 1 here might be just coming out of coding bootcamp, or has experience in other roles, whereas a 5 has a wealth of experience with different businesses/approaches and can talk through pros and cons.

3.  Values Time 

Does this person take the time available into account when building out the software?  This might mean talking through some potential solutions but not implementing them (dropping off endpoint validation, for example), or it also might mean clearly prioritizing they key areas of the route.  A 1 here might rush or feel overwhelmed, and probably focuses more on what hasn't been accomplished, whereas a 5 will look at the time avilable, and prioritize effectively within that.

4. Mentorship

How much do they enjoy walking you through their thought process? Do they enjoy communicating with other people or are they more focused on getting shit done.  A 1 here might be heads down most of the time, whereas a 5 will actively look for mentorship opportunities.


5.  Make Clean Agreements

In a coding interview this means clearly describing what you’re trying to accomplish with code before you walk through it.  Someone who's confident in making clean agreements will set those goals with their interviewer "Now I'm going to implement this POST route in order to solve bullet point 5", whereas someone who's less confident might start work without much of an end in mind.  A 1 here is someone we'll think needs training on how to set clear agreements for their own work, whereas a 5 is someone who will find ways to introduce clean agreements into many areas of the development team.
